        <p>It wasn’t until the 19th century that Americans began to embrace Christmas. Americans re-invented Christmas, and changed it from a raucous carnival holiday into a family-centered day of peace and nostalgia. But what about the 1800s piqued American interest in the holiday?</p>

    <p>The early 19th century was a period of class conflict and turmoil. During this time, unemployment was high and gang rioting by the disenchanted classes often occurred during the Christmas season.

This catalyzed certain members of the upper classes to begin to change the way Christmas was celebrated in America.</p>

Irving’s fictitious celebrants enjoyed “ancient customs,” including the crowning of a Lord of Misrule.
